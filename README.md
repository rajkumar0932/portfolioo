ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi there! I'm Raj Kumar Gupta, a passionate developer and student at NIT Agartala, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey in tech â€” blending creativity with code. I'm especially interested in competitive programming, full-stack web development, and building clean, responsive user interfaces. With 1300+ coding problems solved across platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, and CodeChef, I constantly push myself to improve every day.

Whether it's solving algorithmic puzzles or crafting elegant web experiences, I love learning and sharing what I build. This site is made with ðŸ’™ using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, featuring dark mode, smooth animations, and a mobile-friendly layout.
